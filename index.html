<p>I teach computers to understand music. I also make music. <a href="mailto:2020@superfuzz.me">Talk to me</a> about rock climbing, surfing, yoga, weight lifting, and foosball. Or, about deep learning, probabilistic models, and Python. Better yet, about something I have no clue about.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m bored, I re-tweet stuff <a href="http://twitter.com/fdelamuerte">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="now">Now</h2>
<p>I recently moved back to Vienna, after a year-long stunt in beautiful California. I miss the sunsets, the ocean, and the good people. I&rsquo;m still working as a scientist at Pandora Media on recommending the best songs and artists to listeners. Other than that, I&rsquo;m building my slow life full of love for my partner, Mexican food, and vintage road bikes.</p>
